Redis for token blacklist

Celery + Redis for background workers

PostgreSQL or SQLite (configurable)

Pydantic for data validation

Docker and Docker Compose for containerization


üõ†Ô∏è Production Deployment with AWS Managed Services
Replace local Redis and Postgres containers with AWS services
Service	Local Docker Container	Production AWS Service
Redis	redis:7.2.10 Docker image	AWS ElastiCache Redis cluster endpoint
Postgres	postgres Docker image	AWS RDS PostgreSQL instance endpoint
Email Server	SMTP port 587 (blocked by AWS)	AWS Simple Email Service (SES) via API or SMTP on allowed ports

The following routes ‚Äî /api/v1/user/update-password, /api/v1/user/deactivate-account, /api/v1/user/reactivate-account, /api/v1/user/update-email, /api/v1/user/update-name, /api/v1/user/upload-photo, /api/v1/user/remove-account, /api/v1/user/update-user-balance, /api/v1/books/list-all-books, and /api/v1/order/place-order ‚Äî cannot be tested via Swagger UI, as they are accessible to both regular users and authors, and Swagger does not support passing scopes with authentication. Instead, you can use tools like Postman, cURL, or Burp Suite to make requests with the appropriate scopes.
